# This script is responsible for starting a new tmux session and attaching it to
# the windows of an already running one. The reason this cannot be done by a
# simple 'tmux attach' is that tmux is not sophisticated enough to allow
# different views on a single session.
#
# This script was originally written here:
# http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-836006-start-0.html
#
# Later it was taken and modified by Brandur here:
# https://mutelight.org/practical-tmux
#
# And finally copied and (slightly) modified by ayekat on a sick sunday morning
# in March 2013. Further adapted in February 2015 to respect the XDG base
# directory specifications.

# Configuration location: Check XDG first:
test -n "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME" || XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
tmux_config=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/config
test -e "$tmux_config" || tmux_config="$HOME/.tmux.conf"

# Works because bash automatically trims by assigning to variables and by
# passing arguments:
trim() { echo $1; }

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
	echo "Specify session name as the first argument"
	exit 1
fi

# Only because I often issue 'ls' to this script by accident:
if [ "$1" = 'ls' ]; then
	tmux ls
	exit
fi

base_session="$1"
# This actually works without the trim() on all systems except OSX:
tmux_nb=$(trim $(tmux ls | grep "^$base_session" | wc -l))
if [ "$tmux_nb" = "0" ]; then
	printf "Launching tmux base session %s ...\n" $base_session
	tmux -f "$tmux_config" new-session -s $base_session
else
	# Make sure we are not already in a tmux session:
	if [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
		# Kill defunct sessions first
		old_sessions=$(tmux ls 2>/dev/null | egrep "^[0-9]{14}.*[0-9]+\)$" | cut -f 1 -d:)
		for old_session_id in $old_sessions; do
			tmux kill-session -t $old_session_id
		done

		echo "Launching copy of base session $base_session ..."
		# Session ID is date and time to prevent conflict:
		session_id=`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`
		# Create a new session (without attaching it) and link to base session
		# to share windows:
		tmux -f "$tmux_config" new-session -d -t $base_session -s $session_id
		# Enable this line to create a new window in that session:
		#tmux new-window
		# Attach to the new session:
		tmux -f "$tmux_config" attach-session -t $session_id
		# After having detached from it, kill the session:
		tmux kill-session -t $session_id
	fi
fi
