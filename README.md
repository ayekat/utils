This repository contains a collection of applications and scripts that do not
merit a repository on their own, yet are (more or less) useful for my everyday
use.

There are both simple scripts in the [scripts](/scripts) directory and more
complex (or compiled) programs in their respective directories.

Feel free to explore what's around!
